    <h2>About Ben</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! My name is Ben Aronson and this is my website. I work as a software engineer currently 
      based in Boston, MA. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My approach to life could be closer described as a <b>breadth-first search</b> 
      rather than <b>depth-first</b> (lol). I generally gravitate towards projects, people,
      and passions that are <b>creative, curious, and mission-driven.</b> 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My education in software engineering, experience in consulting, and knack for creativity,
      along with a strong sense of empathy, enables me <b>to forge cross-disciplinary connections between people and ideas.</b>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm still searching for the type of role where I can provide the most impact, but I seem to do well
      leading small teams on projects with clear goals amongst a larger organization 
      with a strong sense of purpose and favorable view on innovation. <br /><br />

    <h3>About Concourse</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Concourse Codes is an attempt to create a digital confluence of all the
    ideas, projects, endeavors, and experiences I have to share with the world.

    Fellow ADHD-ers will relate to the natural impulse towards new and shiny
    things. Instead of viewing our many initatives as failed endeavors, I am on 
    a mission to reframe them as a singular, holistic <i>catalog</i> of our 
    interests, passions, and skills. <br />
    Here, you can read some of my thoughts, experiment with some of my projects, and, if you're 
    observant, explore some of my creative endeavors.

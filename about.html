    Hey! My name is Ben Aronson and this is my website. I am a person who is a
    software engineer currently based in Boston, MA.

    My experience and expertise could be closer described as a breadth-first
    search rather than depth-first (lol), though I generally gravitate towards
    anything to do with front-end development. Most of all, I enjoy learning
    about and applying new technologies to create neat ideas.

    Fellow ADHD-ers will relate to the natural impulse towards new and shiny
    things. While this can be a challenge at times, I also believe that this is
    a beautiful feature of this condition. It allows us to experience a broad
    swath of the human experience, gain deep perspective, and embrace childlike
    joy in discovery and imagination.

    Thus, I hope you find something interesting here.

    <h2>Ben Aronson</h2>
    <h3>Full-Stack Software Engineer • Boston, MA</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Ben. I'm a software dev based in Boston, MA. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I mostly work with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Python building full-stack web apps. 
    </p>
     <br />
    <p>
      I also make music and am passionate about sustainability. I generally gravitate towards projects,
      people, and passions that are creative, curious, and mission-driven. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My education in software engineering, experience in consulting, and knack for creativity,
      along with a strong sense of empathy, enables me <b>to forge cross-disciplinary connections between people and ideas.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>About Concourse</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Concourse Codes is a digital confluence of my ideas, projects, and passions brought into one space. 
    I will be building out a few other formats for Concourse in 2026, so stay tuned. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    It is as much a personal portfolio as it is a mission to reframe the many
    ideas, endeavors, and thoughts as a holistic catalog of creative potential and skill.
    I will be building out a few other formats for Concourse in 2026, so stay tuned.

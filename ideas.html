  <h2>Ideas</h2>
  <p>I eventually hope to share some projects and endeavors that I think would be neat
    but realistically won't get to working on anytime soon (if at all). Here's an example.

  <h4>DJ-curated Music in Grocery Stores</h4>
  <p>Why aren't there any grocery stores or markets that lean into their central
    status in every community? Generally speaking, not everyone visiting a market
    will like the same music, but a bodega-like market serving a niche crowd with live
    or curated music? I'll be there on Friday night!
